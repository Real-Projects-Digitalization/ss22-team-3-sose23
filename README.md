*Hello there, glad to see you are interested in our solution! Feel free to look around and see how we help Teenagers in Germany finding their way back to a normal life.*

<div class=body>

  <h2>The Problem</h2>

There are many homeless teenagers which have trouble finding a save space to sleep. This is a big problem in our society and some companies have dedicated themselves helping exactly those young people. The problem is, there are many Teenagers in need for help, and only a few Socialworkers offering help. 

  <h2>The Solution</h2>

To ensure that every Teenager has the chance to get the help he needs, we came up with the Idea of an AI based Chatbot, which is able to help the Teenagers 24/7 and assist them in things like finding the nearest opportunity to sleep and setting up an appointment with a social worker for further help.

  <h2>Why our Sofahopper Chatbot?</h2>

We created our bot as human like as possible, to ensure the teenagers will feel valued and save. But also we made sure that they will always know, that they are talking to a bot so they wont feel lied to. That paired with our simple and minimalistic design, will not only help them the best way possible, it also will give them a nice and welcoming feeling.

  <h2>Abstract and Challenge Contribution</h2>
The Sofahopper Chatbot project aims to provide a smart solution for addressing the needs of homeless teenagers in Germany by facilitating their access to help and supporting social workers in efficiently handling their requests. Our approach involved identifying the starting point of the assistance process and devising methods to expedite it. Through the development of a chatbot, we conducted comprehensive research, including creating a business canvas, storyboard, and empathy map. The implementation phase is currently underway, and while the chatbot is not live yet, we anticipate significant positive results in terms of expedited assistance and improved support for both homeless teenagers and social workers.
The challenge contribution of the Sofahopper Chatbot project lies in addressing the lack of accessible support for homeless teenagers by providing a 24/7 AI-based chatbot to assist them in finding safe accommodations and efficiently connect them with social workers.
